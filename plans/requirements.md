## 3. User Stories

- **US-1:** As a user, I want to authenticate with my Google account so that the chatbot can access my calendar and email.
- **US-2:** As a user, I want to specify a week off in the chat so that the chatbot can find all meetings during that period.
- **US-3:** As a user, I want the chatbot to show me which meetings are recurring and which are one-off so that I can decide what to do with each.
- **US-4:** As a user, I want the chatbot to cancel all recurring meetings for my week off automatically.
- **US-5:** As a user, I want the chatbot to draft and show me personalized emails for one-off meetings so I can review and send them.
